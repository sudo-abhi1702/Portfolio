        <ul>
            <li><b>FOOTBALL</b> is something that can exhaust my body but not my mind.Although it is a very rough sport and requires lots of stamina and muscle power but it kind of relaxes my mind so much.</li><br>
            <li>Although I have just started doing <b>COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMING</b>,I am liking it very much because it has a touch of JEE Maths.</li><br>
            <li>I love performing <b>DRAMATICS</b>.</li><br>
            <li><b>FICTION READING</b> is also something that i like.</li><br>
